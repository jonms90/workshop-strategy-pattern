# Workshop: Strategy Pattern 
*06.12.2021*

## Background
In this simple demo, we have a console application mimicking a shop listing out their products.
The shopkeeper has always listed the products alphabetically, but wants to start experimenting with different ways of presenting them.

## Tasks

1. Add functionality for listing the cheapest products first.
2. Add functionality for listing the newest products first.
3. Add functionality for listing the most available products first.
